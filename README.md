# FrontierAssistant2
Ever been playing through the Pokemon Emerald Battle Frontier and thought "gosh, this is really hard, I wish I had some sort of software to support my decision making and help me know what I'm up against"?

Then do I have the solution for you! Based off of the Frontier Assistant, this robust upgrade will provide you with key information about every Battle Frontier opponent and what Pokemon they are using so you can gain an edge against the CPU! Simply tell the program what the opposing trainer's name is and what their first Pokemon is, and it will show you all possible movesets it could be. By using information you gain during the battle (what moves or item they have) you can start to rule out what movesets you are up against. From there, that data is used to determine what other sets are possible on their team (remember, they can only have one Pokemon of each species, and one copy of each item). You can also see all kinds of data about their team, including what possible movesets are left, what percent of each remaining Pokemon is of each type, and more!

The program will create a settings file in whatever folder it is in, so it is recommended to put it in its own folder. The settings file will store what level you are playing at (50, Open Level) and any alarms you may want to add. Alarms can be made for moves, items, or species that you think would be a threat to your team, so when they come up, the moveset is displayed in a way to grab your attention so you can play more carefully around the risky moveset. You can also see how many remaining alarming moveset exists for a trainer you are up against, and what exactly set off the alarm. Alarms can be added, deleted, or toggled on or off if you are playing with a team with different weaknesses.
